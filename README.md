Makes highly secure passwords if you enter values into the list, the values should be the least common words in the english dictionary 
therefore would prevent dictionary attacks. I created this script for my passwords therefore I have not entered the list I used. The concept for this 
highly secure password comes from a video I watched about how to create secure passwords.

Here is the link to that video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc
